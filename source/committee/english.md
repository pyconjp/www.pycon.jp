# About the PyCon JP Association

日本語は {doc}`こちら <index>` です。

The **PyCon JP Association** (Japanese: 一般社団法人PyCon JP Association) is a nonprofit organization for Python users in Japan, to promote Python and supports its development. Further it is our goal to hold an annual PyCon JP conference.

## Mission Statement

We do our best planning and manage PyCon JP to create a space where Python Users can network, share their knowledge and find new possibilities. Above all we strive for PyCon JP to be an attractive conference for Python users from Japan and all around the world.

We believe that to maintain PyCon JP as a great conference, holding the conference in the same place in the same season every year is not enough. By cooperating with other conferences in Japan and abroad, encourage the exchange between users and promote Python and software related to Python, more interest in Python can be generated and Python will gain new users and new projects will be created.
